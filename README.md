# Let's fun with my first react love test ;)! Just joking!

Ar first let's see my [First React Love](https://programming-pathshala-react-site.netlify.app/).

* It was my first react site. it was somthing hard more than another assignment. You'll see top 10 programming language creator's some details. they did job under me in my company...joking! just imagine.
* in this site i used sticky summary div. it was my new experience. i tried to do my best.
* most notable thing is, i got a error...and wasted my 6 hour time for that..finally i got solution by just two symbol..but still i don't know what's called that method. i used -  ||{}  - this sign. and got solution.that's for today..see you another day inshallah...allah hafej
